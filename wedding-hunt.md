# Wedding Scavneger Hunt / Travelling Puzzle

## Ideas
- words under someone's name tag on the table
- from my mom
- make a subdomain on the wedding website redirect to my site that has
  - a different clue at each endpoint
  - they need to solve the clues to get to the end clue
  - they need to put their phones together to make a picture
- present at the end is celebrities wishing her a congratulations on the wedding
  - celebrities:
    - Dr. Drew: $155
    - Nick Swardson: $99
    - Stephen Rannazzisi: $100
      - the league
- ~~cake with a picture of us on it~~
- puzzle Ideas
  - childrens puzzle with message on the back
  - include the people handing over the clue in the clue
  - old memories and weird details about people
  - the webpage for each clue has a word puzzle to figure out part of 'BRIDESMAIDS NAMES'
  - at the end of each page you have to put in the letters and that will link you to
- make a large video of lots of people saying nice things about Queta and congratulating her, then end with the celebrities
- make Yasmeen's page say 'Didnt you mean to put in Mrs. DooDooHead? Here's a link for you: Mrs. DooDooHead'

## Process
1. Person gives her a card wherever she is at, at some point
1. She reads the contents
    - there is a clue in the form of a puzzle
1. The result of the solved puzzle leads to grifstuf.com/[the answer to that puzzle]
    - features a nice message and a nice background image
1. The thing at that path leads to a puzzle that gives some of the letters of the final puzzle

## End
1. each bridesmaid pulls out their phone
1. goes to grifstuf.com/[their name]
1. they arrange their phones by number
1. there is a picture of our faces with the words: "GET GRIFFIN'S PHONE"
1. I show her the celebrity videos

## Clues
1. Allison Hadjis
    - somehow get it to Allison ahead of time
      - have Yasmeen give it to her
    - Good morning my love!  
    You are one I can't stop thinking of!  
    Today is the big, special day  
    And I thought it'd be fun to have a game to play.  
    I took some time to dutifully prepare  
    A puzzle for your while Allison beautifies your hair.  
    So sit back, relax, let others do the work,  
    While you think about the best picture we ever had took!  
    Twas very near when our relationship beginned,  
    And after this cut your hair was quite thinned.  
    Afternoon of this day you took off away,  
    To an event that I still remember to this very day.  
    All I need is its name,  
    Then later on you'll do the same  
    With another clue  
    That will be given to you  
    By someone who records peoples faces  
    And this day will follow us around to many places!  
    Take the name of the event that you went to that night  
    And enter it into grifstuf.com, yes that's spelled right.  
    Now let the day go on!  
    It'll be the bomb!  
    And I'll say it again because I know that it's true:  
    I will forever and always love you.

1. Melissa
    - get it to Melissa either that morning or the night before
      - either should be possible
    - It's time for part two!  
    And I still love you!  
    I hope you're still having a great day,  
    On this wonderful, beautiful 4th of May!  
    You always deserve the very best,  
    And with you I am eternally and truly blessed.  
    Get lots of pictures with our photographer,  
    Who was my boss at Caterpillar!  
    That summer I had so much fun making friendships,  
    But that was not the first of my two internships.  
    I had worked at Caterpillar before  
    And got some experience with datas galore!  
    So let's test Melissa's memory real fast,  
    And see if she can remember my bosses past.  
    What was the last name of her predecessor?  
    To figure it out you'll have to be more than a guesser!  
    But don't fret, don't worry, and especially don't fear.  
    The answer to this one and our apartment are quite near.  
    Once more, take the answer and enter it in  
    To grifstuf.com and get a puzzle again!  
    As always, I love you and am currently missing you!  
    And stay tuned till the RME for another clue!  
    Add up our building number and look down below,  
    You should find the next one there, where the Young people go  
    - /brady

1. Hidden in the RedStone Room
    - attach letters to the underside of Table 9, 7, 11, and 13
    - Tables:
      - 7  
      How the time flies by when you have fun!  
      But I'm afraid we're not finished just yet.  
      Over by the grassy highland, go there, you're almost done.  
      Here there's also a water source quite wet.  
      Next: 11  
      - 9  
      So you found the first RedStone one! Yippee!  
      But the next clue's location's a quagmire.  
      "How do we get to the next one?" you'll inquire.  
      Just go to our birth number, bb!  
      Next: 13  
      - 11  
      Right about now you'll need all the RedStone rhyme,  
      And put them in the order you found them.  
      Now starting with the first, take the first letter of every other line  
      And go to grifstuf.com, my good chum!  
      - 13  
      Oh good! You found it! Let's move quickly  
      To the place where two of my people will sit.  
      Each of them have the same name, totally.  
      And at this table they'll fit.  
      Next: 7
    - SHOEHORN vs BJTABHAA
    - /shoehorn
    - /bjtabhaa leads to a hint that tells you to to start differently


1. Ceremony Lady
    - Give to the lady with a literal childrens puzzle when we are both in the church
You've made it quite far!
Hurray Huzzah!
We're getting ever closer to that wonderful time,
When I'll be forever yours and you'll be forever mine.
But the game shall continue,
So here's another clue for you!
I've gotten you a puzzle
That will hopefully your mind confuzzle.

TO BE CONTINUED UPON PURCHASE OF RANDOM THINGS FROM A DOLLAR TREE

1. Tiny Tunes
    - Setup
      - give a letter to Tiny earlier that day when he is setting up the DJ booth
      - ask if he can make the Bridesmaids and Groomsmen sing I'm a little teapot in order for Queta to get the next clue
      - if he thinks it is a bad idea, then have him simply give the clue to Queta when he sees her
    - You made it to the last one!  
    And still the fun is not done!  
    Yet you are so very close,  
    So please dont be morose.  
    You've been through so much today,  
    So I'll make the last one child's play,  
    Since writing poems is really hard-atta.  
    And because I'm really frattata.  
    So here's the last answer: 'my always and forever'  
    Because to say 'I love you' I don't always need to be clever

I take many forms.
When I am expensive, I am old.
When I am in a grocery store, I am young.
When I am around chips, I am not yours.
When I am at Olive Garden, the servers take me everywhere.
Asians can't handle me.
Vegans hate me.
Keto needs me.
Queta loves me.


Clue for the unscrambling: What were those girls standing next to you called again? And all of them have a first, middle, and last one of these, but you, my love, have some extra ones, and as of today a new one! Work together and good luck!!!
