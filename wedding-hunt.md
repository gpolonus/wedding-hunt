## Clues
1. Allison Hadjis
    - somehow get it to Allison ahead of time
      - have Yasmeen give it to her
    - Good morning my love!  
    You're one I can't stop thinking of!  
    Today is the big, special day  
    And I thought it'd be fun to have a game to play.  
    I took some time to dutifully prepare  
    A puzzle for your while Allison beautifies your hair.  
    So sit back, relax, let others do the work,  
    While you think about the best picture we ever had took!  
    Twas very near when our relationship beginned,  
    And after this cut your hair was quite thinned.  
    Afternoon of this day you took off away,  
    To an event that I still remember to this very day.  
    All I need is its name,  
    Then later on you'll do the same  
    With another clue  
    That will be given to you  
    By someone who records peoples faces  
    And this day will follow us around to many places!  
    Take the name of the event that you went to that night  
    And enter it into grifstuf.com, yes that's spelled right.  
    Now let the day go on!  
    It'll be the bomb!  
    And I'll say it again because I know that it's true:  
    I will forever and always love you.

1. Melissa
    - get it to Melissa either that morning or the night before
      - either should be possible
    - It's time for part two!  
    And I still love you!  
    I hope you're still having a great day,  
    On this wonderful, beautiful 4th of May!  
    You always deserve the very best,  
    And with you I am eternally and truly blessed.  
    Get lots of pictures with our photographer,  
    Who was my boss at Caterpillar!  
    That summer I had so much fun making friendships,  
    But that was not the first of my two internships.  
    I had worked at Caterpillar before  
    And got some experience with datas galore!  
    So let's test Melissa's memory real fast,  
    And see if she can remember my bosses past.  
    What was the last name of her predecessor?  
    To figure it out you'll have to be more than a guesser!  
    But don't fret, don't worry, and especially don't fear.  
    The answer to this one and our apartment are quite near.  
    Once more, take the answer and enter it in  
    To grifstuf.com and get a puzzle again!  
    As always, I love you and am currently missing you!  
    And stay tuned till the RME for another clue!  
    Add up our building number and look down below,  
    You should find the next one there, where the Young people go  
    - /brady

1. Hidden in the RedStone Room
    - attach the letter to the underside of Table 9
    -

Hurray Huzzah!
We're getting ever closer to that wonderful time,
When I'll be forever yours and you'll be forever mine.
